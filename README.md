# python-game-stab-the-blobs
A 'game' for learning python.

How to play:
First, you need to install python3 and pygame module.
Run main.py to play the game.
Control the arrow's movement, stab some blobs. Blobs stabbed will expand, and explode in 3 seconds. 
Run out of the blob to avoid damage.
Blobs adjacent to exploded blob will also explode.
You have 100 points of life value.
Because my virtual machine's limited capability, I set the game's window's size pretty small. Edit 'Settings.py' to adjust window's
size and other parameters.
